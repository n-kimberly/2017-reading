<h4><strong>Book Review #15</strong></h4>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Review</h2>
To set the right expectation, this book does not focus on the exhaustive study of emotional intelligence models. The authors have instead opted for more practical objectives. There is an appraisal included with the access code that comes with the book, and the majority of the book is comprised of strategies we can implement every day to improve emotional intelligence. I found these strategies insightful and useful to practice daily.  The stories of low EQ mishaps are more than relatable, and I've personally seen variants of every scenario described. I would go so far as to recommend that these strategies be a required read for all professionals. I've included highlights of these strategies in the summary below. Overall, I enjoyed this book. I do still wish there was a tad more rigor in the intro, where statistics were being presented.

Rating: 8/10
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Summary</h2>
<strong>Emotional Intelligence 2.0</strong> by Dr. Travis Bradberry and Dr. Jean Greaves serves to answer the following two questions:
<ol>
	<li>What is emotional intelligence?</li>
	<li>How do we improve our individual emotional intelligence?</li>
</ol>
Our authors begin by defining emotional intelligence:
<blockquote><em>Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships.</em></blockquote>
Then the authors go into why we should develop our emotional intelligence:
<blockquote><em>...Of all the people we've studied at work, we have found that 90 percent of high performers are also high in EQ. On the flip side, just 20% of low performers are high in EQ. You can be a higher performer without EQ, but the chances are slim...</em>

<em>...The link between EQ and earnings is so direct that every point increase in EQ adds $1,300 to an annual salary. These findings hold true for people in all industries, at all levels, in every region of the world. We haven't yet been able to find a job in which performance and pay aren't tied closely to EQ...</em></blockquote>
The validity of EQ vs. success can be up for debate, since I am not sure about how controlled the correlation between EQ and success is for other factors. However, I think we can all agree that it is more pleasant to be around self-aware people who can regulate their emotions, so let's take the goal of higher EQ as a given and dive into how we can understand and manage our emotions better.

After a chapter on statistics associated with EQ, our authors introduce a framework for understanding, measuring, and improving emotional intelligence. The framework breaks up emotional intelligence into four domains, or skills.

The four domains, in order of increasing complexity are,
<ol>
	<li><strong>Self awareness</strong>: ability to recognize emotions in other people and understand what is happening in a situation</li>
	<li><strong>Self-management</strong>: ability to use our awareness of our emotions to direct our behavior positively</li>
	<li><strong>Social awareness</strong>: ability to recognize emotions in other people and understand what is happening in a situation</li>
	<li><strong>Relationship Management</strong>: ability to use of awareness of emotions to successfully manage our interactions both in the moment and over time.</li>
</ol>
At this point, the author instructs us to take the EQ appraisal. The appraisal is meant to help us identify domains in which we are strong, domains in which we are weak, and track our progress over time.

For example, Relationship management is a skill I want to work at. Self awareness, self management, and social awareness are domains I am naturally more strong in-- but I will need to be more prepared in my interactions with others so that I can manage my relationships better. This was helpful for me to understand.

The remainder of the book covers strategies to improve in each of the domains. I've included highlights of each of the strategies below.
<h3>Advice to develop Domain I: Self-awareness</h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. Quit treating our feelings as good or bad. Judging our emotions prevents us from understanding them. Worse, assigning emotions as good or bad pushes us to let some run wild while repressing others.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. Observe ripple effects from our emotions to understand how one outburst may affect a much wider circle of people long after we'd unleashed our outburst.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. Lean into our discomfort. We tend to try to ignore or minimize unpleasant emotions, but as mentioned, this prevents us from understanding those emotions.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">4. Spot the physical changes that come with our different emotions so that we can anticipate them as they come and work toward regulating them.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">5. Know who and what pushes our buttons. By identifying the exact people, situations, and environments that trigger our emotions we can better determine the source of our woes.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">6. Watch ourselves like a hawk. Develop a more objective understanding of our behavior by taking notice of our emotions and behaviors as a situation unfolds.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">7. Keep a journal about our emotions. Because emotions are so intangible and often ephemeral, we’ll need to write things down in order to understand them better, identify patterns, and track progress.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">8. Don’t be fooled by a bad mood. A bad mood can overshadow all of our emotions, so we need to recognize when it’s the emotional state that’s affecting you rather than an individual emotion.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">9. Don’t be fooled by a good mood, either. We should also seek to understand why our good moods happen, both for the sake of understanding our emotions better, and to avoid harm that can come from a good mood.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">10. Stop and ask ourselves why we do the things we do. Our emotions can alert us to things we may not notice otherwise.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">11. Take a piece of paper and write down our values in one column, and anything we’ve done recently that we’re not proud of in a second column. By contrasting our values, which we are proud of, to emotional outbursts that we are not proud of, we can motivate ourselves to better regulate our emotions.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">12. Observe our facial expressions, body language, clothes, etc. Our physical appearance always gives good clues about how we feel.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">13. Spot our emotions in books, movies, and music. Art that we identify with can offer further clues about our emotions.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">14. Because our understanding of our emotions is limited by our one perspective, getting feedback from others is invaluable. Ask others for specific examples and look for similarities in different people’s answers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">15. Get to know ourselves under stress. Learn to recognize our personal physiological and emotional first signs of stress, and take the time to rest or recharge before that stress piles up.</p>

<h3>Advice to develop Domain II: Self-management</h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. Breathe right, especially when under stress. Oxygen goes first to our body’s vital functions, then to complex functions that help us stay calm.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. Create an emotion vs. reason list. Make a habit of creating a list whenever emotions and reasoning are in conflict, with emotions on one side and rational reasons on the other. Use the list to identify which emotions aren’t valid, and which ones offer cues to reasons we may have missed.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. Make goals public! By making goals public we can harness the motivation of the expectations of others. Share the right goals with the right people who will keep us accountable for each one.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">4. Count to ten. This basic self-management trick re-engages our rational mind when necessary. We can do something else like take a drink to get the same effect and give ourselves those few moments.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">5. Sleep on it. Time will often give us clarity by allowing emotions to run their course and settle down before we make a decision.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">6. Talk to a skilled self-manager. Ask a skilled self-manager about his or her self-management processes in order to gain insights to modify our own behavior.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">7. Smile and laugh more. Because changing our external expression can influence our internal mood, smiling can counteract a negative mood.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">8. Set aside time for problem solving. Take 15 minutes to stop the flurry of activity and emotion and think without disturbances.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">9. Take control of our self-talk. The average person has about 50,000 thoughts per day, each of which trigger chemical reactions in our brain that influence our emotions and behavior. We can improve our self-management by identifying negative self-talk (I always, I never, I’m an idiot, it’s their fault, etc.) and replacing it with healthier thoughts (sometimes I make that mistake, I accept responsibility, etc.).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">10. Visualize ourselves succeeding. Because our brain reacts the same way to visualizing something as it does to us actually experiencing it, visualization is a simple but powerful tool to prime ourselves for success.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">11. Clean up our sleep hygiene. We need 20 minutes of natural morning sunlight each day to reset our biological clock. Avoid caffeine after breakfast, screens for two hours before bed, and activities such as working or watching TV in bed.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">12. Focus on our freedoms, rather than our limitations. Take accountability for what we can influence in any situation (such as our own attitudes and reactions), instead of worrying about things beyond our control.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">13. Stay synchronized. If our body language doesn’t match the situation, it’s a sign that our emotions are out of whack.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">14. Speak to someone who is not emotionally invested in our problem to better understand situation.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">15. Always be asking ourselves what we can learn about ourselves or others from others’ behavior, and we'll experience negative emotional reaction much less frequently.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">16. Put physical exercise on our schedule rather than trying to fit it in if we have time. Physical activity gives our brain an important rest, in addition to the physical benefits.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">17. Accept that change is just around the corner. Because people tend to be upset by change, acceptance that change is inevitable will save us a great deal of stress. The authors suggest taking time every week or two to write down some changes that could potentially happen in important areas of our lives, as well as actions we would take if those changes happen.</p>

<h3>Advice to develop Domain III: Social-awareness</h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. Greet people by name. Using and remembering someone’s name is a basic way to engage them.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. Watch body language. By becoming an expert reader of body language, we'll be better able to recognize emotional cues and adapt accordingly.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. Focus on the other person’s emotional state and frame of mind, instead of our own, to ascertain the right timing for what we need to communicate.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">4. Develop a back-pocket question. This social awareness strategy buys us time so that we can get to know the other person better and shows that we are interested in their thoughts, feelings, and ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">5. Don’t take notes at meetings. If we are focused on taking notes, we will likely miss important cues in the conversation. Most communication happens nonverbally, so whenever possible we should focus on the individuals, not our notes. If note-taking is necessary, make sure to take breaks at regular intervals to observe the people in the meeting and pick up emotional cues.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">6. Plan ahead for social gatherings. It seems a bit stilted, but the reality is that planning ahead will allow us to be more emotionally present at the event. Write down anything we want to be sure to accomplish, and we'll forget less while noticing more.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">7. Clear away the clutter. This involves bettering our listening skills by focusing on the other person’s words and expressions instead of thinking about what we want to say next.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">8. Live in the moment. Being present wherever we are instead of wasting our time regretting the past and worrying about the future will allow us to be more perceptive of the people around us.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">9. Go on a 15-minute tour. Walk around and observe emotional cues: the look of people’s workspaces, the timing of people’s movements, the overall mood, etc.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">10. Watch EQ at the movies. Take the time to watch two movies specifically for the purpose of observing the character’s emotions, body language, relationships, interactions, etc.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">11. Practice the art of listening. This means practicing a conscious focus on the speaker, and the tone, speed, and volume of their voice.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">12. Go people watching. In order to improve our social awareness abilities, go to a coffee shop, grocery store, or other public place with the express purpose of observing people’s emotional states.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">13. Understand the rules of the culture game. In today’s world, being socially aware requires that we develop emotional intelligence across the spectrum of the world’s cultures. This is a complex endeavor, as every culture has its own norms for personal, family, and business interactions. It will require patience as we watch and observe, taking extra time to understand the cultural expectations of people outside our own culture.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">14. Test for accuracy. If we're not sure what a cue is telling us about someone, we can always ask. State what we see (“You seem sad…”) and ask a direct question (“Did something happen?”)</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">15. Remember that people have different backgrounds and motivations. Put ourselves in their situation, and from the perspective of how they would see things, try to understand why they are acting the way they are. When possible, check with them to see if our guesses are correct.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">16. Seek the whole picture. Ask people about their perceptions of us, or send out a 360-degree survey to get feedback that will help us understand how we appear to others.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">17. Catch the mood of the room. Moving from perception of individuals to being able to read the room is a big leap in abilities.</p>

<h3>Domain IV: Relationship Management</h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. Be open and be curious. Sharing things about ourselves will leave less room for people to misinterpret us, and the more we know about someone else, the more clearly we can interpret their emotional signals.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. Enhance our natural communication style. We can all benefit from understanding and adjusting our natural communication style, tailoring to others' needs.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. Avoid giving mixed signals. It’s possible to be saying something that’s on our mind while simultaneously exhibiting body language that shows a different emotion that is still lingering from a completely separate situation or conversation.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">4. Remember the little things that pack a punch. Add back some old-fashioned good manners into the way we talk if we're not already in the habit of saying the little things like “please,” “thank you,” and “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">5. Take feedback well. Appreciate the feedback we get, and be mindful of our response. Ask for examples in order to really understand what is being said, and thank the person for the feedback.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">6. Build trust. Start the trust-building process by being the first person to “be open” and share something.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">7. Have an “open-door” policy. People will feel valued and respected because of the time we're giving them; and we get the opportunity to learn from others.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">8. Only get mad on purpose. <em>Anyone can get angry-- that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right away, this is not easy.</em> Anger can sometimes enhance relationships (think football coach), but we must control our anger and not let it control us. An approach would be to write down what we want to communicate, the degree of anger with which we want to express, and how this would enhance our relationship with the other person.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">9. When we’re faced with a situation we don’t like, don’t withdraw; it will only make things worse. Apply our EQ skills to find something that helps us through the situation or improve it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">10. Acknowledge the other person’s feelings. Respect the right to those feelings, even if we don’t agree with the feelings themselves. Listen and repeat back what we've heard to show our understanding and concern.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">11. Complement the person’s emotions or situation. We often have a tendency to reflect the other person’s emotions, but responding to anger with anger, for example, will only make things worse. Take the time to consider some past situations we've experienced, and think about when someone else acted in a way that complemented our emotions, making the interaction a pleasant one.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">12. When we care, show it. Small acts of appreciation can create powerful relationships.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">13. Explain our decisions, don’t just make them. People need to understand why a decision was made in order to support it. Seek input before the decision if possible, and always acknowledge the effects of the decision.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">14. Make feedback direct and constructive. The key to giving good feedback is to consider the person who is receiving the feedback, and to adapt our approach accordingly.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">15. Align intention with impact. Think about times when we unintentionally caused hard feelings, or relationships that seem illogically strained.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">16. Learn to recognize when a conversation is deteriorating, and say something like, “This is hard,” or “How are you feeling?” Offer a reset button to restore open lines of communication.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">17. Tough conversations will come up no matter how high our EQ is. Tackling them well will only enhance our relationships. A good approach would be to start the discussion with some common ground, and ask the other person to help us understand how they feel. Then help the person understand our side. Follow up concerning what has been discussed at a later time as a means of genuinely addressing the issues.</p>
