<h4>Clayton M. Christensen is the Kim B. Clark Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School. Christensen is the co-founder of Innosight, a growth-strategy consultancy; Rose Park Advisors, an investment firm; and the Christensen Institute, a non-profit think tank. In 2011 and 2013, he was named the world’s most influential business thinker by Thinkers50.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Review</h2>
Christensen begins with an introduction summarizing the two main questions he set out to answer:
<ol>
	<li>Why is success so difficult to sustain?</li>
	<li>Is successful innovation really as unpredictable as the data suggests?</li>
</ol>
His first chapter then delves into technological advances in the disk drive industry alongside the business successes and failures of its players. Defining organizations as entrants or incumbents to a particular technology, Christensen begins highlighting when they would fail and when they would succeed. All throughout, a pattern begins to emerge. When the technology was sustaining, incumbents often had the upper hand and would beat out the competition. When the  technology was disruptive, entrants often had the upper hand and would undermine the incumbents.

Sustaining technology, as defined by Christensen, is one which improves upon the performance on a particular set of attributes for the mainstream customer market. This improvement could be incremental or radical, but if it improves a known desired attribute of a current technology, then it is considered sustaining. On the other hand, disruptive technology is defined to be technology that alters the dimensions of performance. It is <em>not</em> as competitive as existing technology with respect to a current desired attribute, but it does provide some other attribute that perhaps only customers of a small niche market wants (i.e. cheaper, smaller). The primary example that Christensen provides is the drive industry pivoting from 14" to 8" to 5.25" to 3.5 and then 2.5" drives.

In the graph attached above, we can see that the smaller drives often had lower capacity when first introduced to the market. But also readily apparent is that the larger, higher capacity disk drives would overshoot market demand. This left a vacuum, which the smaller, lower capacity disk drives then filled as technology developed. The lower capacity disk drives need only to grow at a rate higher than the growth rate of market demand.

With Christensen's findings out there, this would seem like an easy problem for incumbents to solve. If the characteristics of disruptive technology are so obvious, incumbents could simply start investing in disruptive projects, right? This is where I think the true value of Christensen's research lies.<strong> </strong>It also is where more data could be presented. Thanks to Christensen and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/30/christensen-vs-lepore-a-matter-of-fact/">Thomas Thurston</a>, the theory of disruption seems to yield results that are more accurate than any other business model out there (~85%). However, the hypothesis of value networks was presented without much development. In the book at least, Christensen picked out some case studies of a handful of businesses to make his case. It would be nice to see more data here. He does emphasize, however, that a purpose of sharing his work is to develop it further.

In what I see is his most compelling argument, Christensen attributes the failures of large organizations in emerging markets to the concept of resource allocation and differing value networks.

Large organizations have an obligation to shareholders, who in turn gain the most profit when mainstream customers are satisfied. Because large organizations require a lot more revenue to maintain operations and must generate a lot more revenue to meet growth projections, they are bound to their most profitable market: mainstream customers. The value network of a large organization prioritizes the allocation of resources to its mainstream customers. Dedicating resources to emerging, less profitable, niche markets is almost an impossible task for large organizations. Even when a large organization can muster the funds to sponsor efforts toward disruptive technology, the value network of the organization, which dictate its values and processes, often cause such efforts to still fail. In large organizations, company values and processes are bigger, more stubborn players than the people themselves.

On the other hand, in small organizations, Christensen points out that people play a bigger role how resource is divested than the company values and processes. Similarly, with less requirements on revenue, smaller organizations are viable when they compete in niche markets. An emerging value network develops in the organizations, giving smaller players a distinct advantage in acquiring emerging markets.

What could large incumbent organizations do then? Christensen suggests creating an independent entity- a spin off, or acquiring a small company and running it separately as its own business. The idea is to keep its resource allocation process and its value network separate from the parent company.

In <em>The Innovator's Dilemma, </em>Christensen gathers insights into a problem <strong>and </strong>provides a potential solution. The use of the word disruption may be overrated and overdone, but Christensen's work is not.
