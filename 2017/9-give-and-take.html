<h4><strong>Book Review #9</strong></h4>
<h2>Review</h2>
I loved this book because Adam Grant conducts meticulous research that shows the true impact of givers in the workplace-- and the true cost that takers inflict.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5616" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/give-take-03.jpg" alt="Give-Take-03" width="883" height="361" />

Give and Take was one parts validation for the givers of the world, one parts critique for those who don't know how to manage their time and end up at the bottom, and one parts advice on how to keep takers out so that teams can be less paranoid and more effective.

Rating: 9/10
<h2>Reflection</h2>
In Give and Take, Adam makes a remark and poses a question that I felt uneasy about.

Adam states,
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring their productivity. I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue. And, unexpectedly, <strong>the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers.</strong></em></p>
Well, darn. That's just unfair.

Then he asks,
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved?</em></p>
Sure-- I can name about forty. I had actively mentored and advocated for over 60 students to help them land their first internship, job, or promotion, and had a nearly 70% success rate. Even as a graduate no longer directly involved in the program, I've written recommendations for 18 students and continue to review resumes.

It was when I thought of my supervisors and people further out in their careers that I felt uneasy. I couldn't name more than one supervisor or upperclassmen whose careers I've fundamentally improved. I began to wonder why I've been nearly powerless to improve the careers of my boss or my boss's boss. I started to think about the handful of peers I knew who were very good at helping their bosses and high-level executives. And I started to doubt my own personal effectiveness.

My experience with Give and Take was filled with moments like this. Adam's questions, comments and research engaged me in thoughtful reflection nearly every chapter. It is the kind of book that will likely change the way you go about your day to day.

What have I learned?

With respect to the first question I referenced, Grant answer based on his research showed me that I went about it all wrong.

In Grant's own words,
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good.</em></p>
Then he goes on to present the other finding of his research:
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>So I wondered, then, if givers are the worst performers, who are the best performers? Let me start with the good news: it's not the takers... And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers who are the best performers. But they're not.<strong> In every job, in every organization I've ever studied, the best results belong to the givers again.</strong></em></p>
The research he presented was empowering.

This book is for all the givers of the world. The ones who feel like they are less effective- that they are doormats- that they will earn less throughout their lifetimes because they put others' needs above their own. Thanks to Adam's research, there's a way to change all of that. And that's in understanding why givers also dominate at the top.

Who are givers?
<ol>
	<li>They provide a safe space where everyone feels encouraged to share their ideas.</li>
	<li>They practice powerless communication by asking questions, signaling vulnerability, and seeking advice.</li>
	<li>They treat subordinates extremely well.</li>
	<li>They earn 'idiosyncrasy credits', where their positive impressions have allowed them to deviate from group norms or expectations.</li>
	<li>They tend to be optimistic and see everyone as bloomers-- and often times this is a self-fulfilling prophecy where recipients do actually become more successful for it.</li>
	<li>They are willing to admit personal mistakes and de-escalate commitment.</li>
	<li>They engage in a lot of volunteering.</li>
	<li>They tend to show too much empathy.</li>
	<li>They have some trouble advocating for their own interests but have no problem advocating for others' interests.</li>
	<li>They exhaust themselves.</li>
</ol>
Successful givers are different from the givers who burn out and stay at the bottom of the ladder in the following ways:
<ul>
	<li>They recognize that there is a time and place for giving and getting your work done</li>
	<li>They draw assertiveness from their commitments to the people who matter to them</li>
	<li>They learn to do ‘sincerity screenings’ for individuals.</li>
	<li>They are good at identifying opportunities where they can maximize benefits to others at low costs to themselves.</li>
</ul>
Now that makes for a great action plan.
