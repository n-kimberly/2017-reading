<em>NEW MBA GRADUATE: I have the answer! My excel spreadsheet says that we should reorganize the company by geographic region rather than by product. We could save at least three million dollars a year by cutting unnecessary staff and travel.</em>

<em>BOSS: Sounds great. You've been with the company seven months and you want to do a radical reorganization. I assume you already assembled a roster of redundant employees?</em>

<em>NEW MBA GRADUATE: Well, I've not thought about it through that far yet.</em>

<em>Quantitative skills may provide the magic theoretical pill in the classroom, but OB tries to instill in young MBA Turks the human sensitivity to apply their MBA skills in the real world. The idea behind studying organizational behavior is to train MBAs to avoid tactical errors because they failed to take into consideration the people involved.</em>

<h3>I. Problem-solving Model</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Problem Definition</li>
	<li>Analysis</li>
	<li>Action Planning</li>
</ul>
<strong>Problem Definition</strong>: Problems exist when there is a gap between what a manager thinks ought to happen and what is actually occurring. To define a problem, we can engage all participants and outline their <em>Want-Got-Gaps</em>. Then when we know what gap exists, we can determine the extent of the problem. Is it between departments? Among the whole organization? Just a particular group? Finally, we go on to decide which problems are source problems, and which are merely causes of the source problem.

<strong>Analysis</strong>: This is where we try to understand the causes. Why do they exist? What environmental factors are at play?

<strong>Action Planning</strong>: The action plan contains six important steps,
<ol>
	<li>Set specific goals</li>
	<li>Definite activities, resources needed, responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Set a timetable for action</li>
	<li>Forecast outcomes, develop contingencies</li>
	<li>Formulate a detailed plan of action in time sequence</li>
	<li>Implement, supervise execution, and evaluate based on goals in step one</li>
</ol>
<h3>II. Psychology Lesson</h3>
<strong>The APCFB Model</strong>: Assumptions affect perceptions people have. Those perceptions affect the conclusions. And those conclusions prompt feelings. Ultimately, those feelings drive behaviors that managers observe.
<h1><img class=" size-large wp-image-7054 aligncenter" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24623558_1477714692345628_33722360_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="24623558_1477714692345628_33722360_o" width="1024" height="1001" /></h1>
To complicate things further, we all see through filters that prevent us from perceiving events accurately. Filters also prevent us from acting out our true desires. Indeed, we also have internal defense mechanisms that act as additional filters to protect us from psychological damage.
<h3>III. Motivation</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Expectancy Theory of Motivation</strong></p>

<pre>  Motivation =
    Expectation of Work will lead to performance
    * Expectation Performance will lead to reward
    * Value of Reward
</pre>
If an employee is in a hopeless position where they don't feel like working harder would affect the result, motivation would decrease. Similarly, even if the employee is performing very well, if they do not feel like their performance is correlated to reward, then motivation will also decrease. Finally, if the reward is small to begin with, then it may have little bearing on the employee's motivation.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Frameworks for motivation</strong></p>
<strong>Hertzberg</strong> posits that motivation will be enhanced by maximizing <em>satisfiers</em> on the job and minimizing <em>dissatisfiers</em>. Satisfiers can be promotion or award, while dissatisfiers can be an unsafe environment or unlivable wage.

<strong>Maslow</strong> constructed a pyramid that proposes a hierarchy of needs innate in every individual. In order to get to the next level, former levels must be satisfied.
<h1><img class=" size-large wp-image-7055 aligncenter" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/maslow.jpg?w=1024" alt="maslow" width="1024" height="762" /></h1>
<strong>McCleland</strong> believes that people only have three basic needs: the need for achievement, power, and affiliation.

Regardless of the theory, the overall takeaway is that managers must recognize the needs of employees.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Motivation through Job Design</strong></p>
Another way to understand and affect employee motivation is to investigate the way the job is designed. Each job has core job dimensions that describe duties performed. These duties lead to critical psychological states within employees that result in a variety of outcomes.
<h1><img class=" size-large wp-image-7056 aligncenter" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24623637_1477714685678962_619732619_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="24623637_1477714685678962_619732619_o" width="1024" height="977" /></h1>
<h3>IV. Personality Traits of Leaders</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The VCM Model of Leadership</strong></p>
The VCM Model proposes that the following three characteristics are part of a leader's personal profile.
<ul>
	<li>Vision</li>
	<li>Commitment</li>
	<li>Management Skills</li>
</ul>
Leaders can exist these qualities in differing proportions of course, and there is no particular mix that works best.
<h1><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7057" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24739922_1477714675678963_92140368_o-1.jpg?w=1024" alt="24739922_1477714675678963_92140368_o (1)" width="1024" height="641" /></h1>
Which leadership style a leader chooses can also depend on the situation. If a staff doesn't have the ability to work unsupervised, a full delegation of authority is inappropriate. When the staff has a clear understanding of the business situation and how to address it, it's best to delegate authority.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Creativity</strong></p>
Because vision is an element in the VCM pie, MBAs ought to nurture their own creativity. Everyone has idea friendly times when they are most creative. Creative thoughts are often fleeting, so you must work at capturing them in their tender, nascent stage. Mind mapping is a great technique that helps with exercising free association.
<h1><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7058" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24474970_1477714705678960_1554898749_o.jpg?w=814" alt="24474970_1477714705678960_1554898749_o" width="814" height="1024" /></h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong></p>
It's debatable whether entrepreneurship can be taught, but business schools still try anyway. Studies of entrepreneurs reveal that they possess some combination of the following characteristics,
<ul>
	<li>Comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty</li>
	<li>Believe that they control their own destinies</li>
	<li>Tenacity in completing tasks</li>
	<li>Low fear of failure</li>
	<li>Ability to identify opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. On-the-job Office Procedure</h3>
In this section, Silbiger highlights some practical advice he got from his OB faculty to help him succeed on the job.

These include,
<ul>
	<li>Listen Actively</li>
	<li>Understand the Performance Appraisal Process</li>
	<li>Manage your boss</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Active Listening</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Respond to information and don't lead</li>
	<li>Respond to personal information and don't give advice</li>
	<li>Identify the interviewee's feelings as well as the content</li>
</ul>
Then, as Silbiger jokes,
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"...after the active listening session runs its course, you can start to talk and act like an MBA know-it-all again."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Performance Appraisals</strong></p>
Performance appraisals are meant to
<ol>
	<li>Ensure proper conduct and levels of performance, placement, promotion, and pay</li>
	<li>Provide both employees and employers with a formal process and documentation of performance</li>
	<li>Coach and develop</li>
</ol>
This last one is ultimately the primary goals of an appraisal. Think: how can we improve rather than punish unsatisfactory performance? Indeed, before reprimanding, ask yourself if you caused the problem. Then give a warning that you need to talk about the problem. Do not yell-- but tell exactly as you see it. Display a caring attitude. "Let's learn from this and put it behind us."
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Managing Your Boss</strong></p>
MBAs are not always bosses. Most start out as lowly analysts, planners, and associates. Management of relationship upward is as important as managing your relationship below.
<ol>
	<li>Understand your boss through identifying their stated and unstated goals and objectives, the pressures on them, their strengths, weaknesses and blind spots, and their preferred work styles.</li>
	<li>Understand yourself through identifying your own strengths and weaknesses, your personal style, and your predisposition toward dependence on or resistance to authority figures.</li>
	<li>Develop and maintain a relationship that fits both your needs and styles, is characterized by mutual expectations, keeps your boss informed, is based on dependability and honesty, and selectively uses your boss's time and resources.</li>
</ol>
<h3>VI. Power</h3>
Understanding power on the job is critical. Widely accepted is the five powers model.
<ul>
	<li>Coercive is based on punishment and fear.</li>
	<li>Reward is based on praise and recognition.</li>
	<li>Referent is driven by respect and admiration.</li>
	<li>Legitimate is instilled through formal status.</li>
	<li>Expert is founded on skill, knowledge, and experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VII. The Organizational Model and Structures</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Basic Organizational Model</strong></p>
Organizations affect the individuals, who stand at the center of the model. There are often six elements that define organizations. These include,
<ul>
	<li>Strategy</li>
	<li>Policies & Procedures</li>
	<li>Structure</li>
	<li>Systems</li>
	<li>Climate</li>
	<li>Culture</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Organizational Structure</strong></p>
Organizational structures affect how individuals operate. There are about 7 different types of structures. Of course, many large companies may contain hybrids of these.
<ol>
	<li>Functional</li>
	<li>Product</li>
	<li>Customer</li>
	<li>Geographic</li>
	<li>Divisional</li>
	<li>Matrix</li>
	<li>Amorphous</li>
</ol>
In organizational structures with middle managers, there is a common business tactic to cut costs by increasing the span of control of higher level managers and cutting out the middle manager.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Human Talent Flow Pyramid</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The structure of a firm dictates not only how employees are grouped but also how they can advance. When there are blockages in the pyramid, people can get frustrated and leave, resulting in a leakage in the talent pyramid.</p>

Discrimination issues such as <em>glass ceilings</em> for women and minority promotions can be analyzed using this pictorial technique.
<h3>VIII. Systems Theory</h3>
According to systems theory, organizations are comprised of six primary functions, resembling a paramecium.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7061" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24651113_1477714719012292_855266285_o.jpg?w=993" alt="24651113_1477714719012292_855266285_o" width="993" height="1024" />

<h3>IX. Organizational Evolution and Revolution</h3>
This is by far my favorite graphic in this chapter.
<h1><img class=" size-large wp-image-7060 aligncenter" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24623642_1477714722345625_1908052300_o.jpg?w=1003" alt="24623642_1477714722345625_1908052300_o" width="1003" height="1024" /></h1>
I like the case that Silbiger makes about Apple.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Growth through creativity</strong></p>
Apple Computer sprang forth from the <em>creativity</em> of Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Crisis of Leadership</strong></p>
Beginning in 1976, these two entrepreneurs were on a freight train of rapid growth until the company became so unwieldy that it almost jumped the tracked in 1983. Apple was faced with a <em>leadership crisis</em> of a growth company that didn't have anyone who could efficiently run its day-to-day operations. Jobs was a lofty visionary making speeches, while Wozniak was the magic technician. The company started to run out of gas as its creative fuel ran low. Apple II sales slumped and the new Lisa computer failed.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Growth through direction</strong></p>
John Sculley was brought in from Pepsi-Cola to give the company <em>direction</em>.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Crisis of autonomy</strong></p>
Sculley reorganized Apple and cut costs in its bloated headquarters. Steve Jobs and his followers demanded more <em>autonomy</em> to develop a new breakthrough product, and Sculley gave it to them.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Growth through delegation</strong></p>
The <em>delegation</em> results in the creation of the Macintosh.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Crisis of control</strong></p>
That Mac created another explosive growth period. However Jobs could not work in a growing corporate bureaucracy, and he started a new company called NeXT. In 1989, the aging Mac faced fierce competition, and as profits declined in 1990, a new Apple crisis of <em>Control</em> was brewing.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Growth through coordination</strong></p>
Michael Spindler was appointed as COO to assist Sculley as chairman to take control and return the company to increase profitability.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Crisis of RED TAPE</strong></p>
By 1992, they had succeeded but fell into crisis in 1995.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Growth through collaboration</strong></p>
Steve Jobs returned and led another recovery in 1998 with the iMac and G3 computers, in 2002 with the iPod music player, in 2007 with the iPhone, and in 2010 with the iPad.

<h2>From the author,</h2>
<em>After I earned my MBA, I had a chance to reflect on the two most exhausting and fulfilling years of my life. As I reviewed my course notes, I realized that the basics of an MBA education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience...</em>

<img class=" size-medium wp-image-6200 aligncenter" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ten-day-dsc_1655-1038x576.jpg?w=300" alt="ten-day-DSC_1655-1038x576" width="300" height="166" />

<em>The basics of MBA knowledge fall into nine disciplines. Some schools have carefully crafted their own exalted names for each subject, but their unglorified names are:</em>
<ol>
	<li><em>Marketing</em></li>
	<li><em>Ethics</em></li>
	<li><em>Accounting</em></li>
	<li><em>Organizational Behavior</em></li>
	<li><em>Quantitative Analysis</em></li>
	<li><em>Finance</em></li>
	<li><em>Operations</em></li>
	<li><em>Economics</em></li>
	<li><em>Strategy</em></li>
</ol>
This particular post covers Day 4: Organizational Behavior.
