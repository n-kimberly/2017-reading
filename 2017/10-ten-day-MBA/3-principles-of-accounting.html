<h3>I. Accounting Rules</h3>
Accounting has innumerable rules. MBAs should have sufficient familiarity with the rules in order to communicate CPAs- but by no means should we need to memorize them all.

<strong> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) </strong> have been developed over the years and are analogous to precedents in the legal profession. Additional rules have been developed by the <strong> Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)</strong> to deal with new areas of business activity. These 'Fasbee' rules are generally referred to by number.

In 2009, FASB created the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), which simply organized all old and new rules into topics for easier reference. <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/cfodirect/assets/pdf/accounting-guides/pwc_codification_quick_reference_guide.pdf">The ASC is now considered the single source of GAAP rules.</a>

Internationally, there is the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which has created its own set of guidelines called the <strong> International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</strong>. These are less detailed and are more principles-based, allowing companies to use their judgment.

In terms of convergence between the two, <a href="https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/fasb-continues-engagement-with-iasb-on-ifrs">Leaders of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board pledged Tuesday to continue their work together, even after completing their major convergence projects for harmonizing standards</a>.
<h3>II. Accounting Concepts</h3>
Rules do not tell the whole story. The following seven concepts are a guiding set of policies that underlie all accounting rules and reporting.
<ul>
	<li>The Entity</li>
	<li>Cash Basis and Accrual Accounting</li>
	<li>Transaction Definition and Objectivity</li>
	<li>Accounting Conservation and Historical Costs</li>
	<li>Going Concern</li>
	<li>Consistency</li>
	<li>Materiality</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Entity</strong></p>
The scope of accounting reports is confined to a specific entity. Entities may be a single grocery store, a production plant, an entire business, or a conglomerate. The entity represents the 'control volume' by which accountants evaluate. Financial activities that enter and leave the entity is tracked in accounting reports.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Cash and Accrual Accounting</strong></p>
There are two methods of accounting. For the most part, smaller companies generally use <strong>cash basis</strong> accounting, while companies of any significant size will use the accrual accounting method.

<strong>Cash Basis</strong>: Does not try to match costs of conducting business and related sales, merely captures when and how much cash changed hands.

<strong>Accrual</strong>: Larger companies use the accrual method since it recognizes the financial effects of an activity without regard to the movement of cash. This disconnect between activity and recording, however, makes it easy for accountants to manipulate financial reports by choosing when to record certain sales or expenses in order to cover up for a bad quarter or year. For this reason, the period of recognition is very important. When using accrual accounting, <strong>allocation and <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/matching-concept-related-cash-accounting-accrual-accounting-business-56283.html">the matching principle</a></strong>Â rules must be taken into consideration to prevent this sort of manipulation.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Transaction Definition and Objectivity</strong></p>
Accounting records only contain transactions that have been completed and have a 'quantifiable' and enforceable monetary value. Sales that have not been completed, but are thought of as sure things cannot be recorded.

The objectivity rule dictates that there must be 'reasonable' and 'verifiable' evidence to support the transaction before it can be recorded.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Conservatism</strong></p>
Conservatism tries to play it safe to prevent the risk of overvaluing the company.

In complying with conservatism, when gains are expected, accountants postpone recording them until they are actually realized. On the other hand, conservatism dictates that when companies incur losses that are probable and that can be reasonably estimated, accountants can record them even if they haven't been realized.

Conservatism also dictates that transactions be recorded at their historical costs. i.e. if the value of property appreciates, do not record that. In the conservative accountant's mind, the property may very well decline by the time it's sold. Now, if the value of an asset falls below recorded cost, that's another story. The loss would be recognized today.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Going Concern</strong></p>
This guiding principle is rather simple: assume that business is a going concern -- that it will continue to operate in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the value of assets are not fire sale prices but are valued assuming that the company is using its machinery productively.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
Consistency simply states that companies ought to use the same rules year after year.

For example, there are two methods of inventory evaluation. Companies can either value their inventory in accordance with <strong>First in First out (FIFO)</strong> or <strong>Last in First out (LIFO)</strong>.

FIFO has the oldest purchase costs of goods as being recognized first, while LIFO has the most recent purchase costs of goods as being recognized first. So if you bought a bar of gold back in the 90's and a bar of gold today, and then sold one bar of gold, FIFO would have it that you record the revenue from the sale based on the price of the first bar of gold you had bought.

What's important is that companies are consistent in sticking to one method once they've chosen it. Otherwise, accountants could easily manipulate the perception of performance by switching between methods.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Materiality</strong></p>
Simply put, financial statements may not be precise, but they should provide a 'fairly stated' view of where an entity stands. Coca-Cola may have million-dollar errors in their reports and not materially distort the picture for decision-making. Accounting's responsibility to the public is to inform the public on the health of the business.
<h3>III. The Financial Statements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Balance Sheet</li>
	<li>The Income Statement</li>
	<li>The Statement of Cash Flows</li>
</ul>
<strong>The statement of cash flows</strong> demonstrates that changes in the cash balance had to result from changes in assets, liabilities, and owners equity. The assets and liabilities changes came from <strong>the balance sheet</strong>. The owners' equity changes were the results of changes in net income, which is provided by the <strong>income statement</strong>. In other words, the three basic financial statements are inextricably tied together.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Balance Sheet</strong></p>
The Balance Sheet simply shows the balances as of a specific date. It is a snapshot of the company's holdings at a given time. In the balance sheet are entries representing the assets owned by a company, the liabilities owed to others, and the accumulated investment of its owners.

<strong>Assets</strong> are the resources that the company possesses for the future benefit of the business. These may be in the form of cash, inventory, customers receivables, equipment, and buildings.

<strong>Liabilities</strong> are dollar-specific obligations to repay borrowing, debt, etc. These may be in the form of bank debt, accounts payable, advances from customers, taxes owed, or wages owed to employees.

<strong>Owners's equity</strong> is the accumulated dollar measure of the owners' investment in the company. These are commonly in the form of common stock, additional paid-in capital, or retained earnings.

<strong>The Fundamental Accounting Equation</strong> that rule over accounting balance is,
<pre>Assets (A) = Liabilities (L) + Owners' Equity (OE)</pre>
In other words, what you own is the sum of what you borrow and what you have invested to pay for it.

<strong>The Double Entry System</strong>: Accountants refer to their books the <strong>general ledger</strong>. In the ledger is the chart of accounts. Assets are placed on the left side, called a <em>debit</em>, while liabilities and owners' equity additions are placed on the right side, called a <em>credit</em>.

<strong>In all cases, journal entries have at least two lines of data, a debit and a credit</strong>. When assets are reduced, an increase in liability or OE invariably follows. Take the investment of $15,000 in exchange for 1,000 shares of stock of a company you're founding, the journal would record the two following entries,
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Account</th>
<th>Title</th>
<th>Debit</th>
<th>Credit</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cash</td>
<td>(Asset)</td>
<td>15,000</td>
<td></td>
<td>Increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Common Stock</td>
<td>(OE)</td>
<td></td>
<td>15,000</td>
<td>Increase</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<strong>Liquidity</strong>: An important aspect of the balance sheet is that the assets and liabilities are listed in order of their liquidity, from most liquid to least.

On the assets side, that means that <strong>current assets</strong>, like cash, accounts receivable from customers, and inventory is placed first since they are easily converted into cash within next operating period. <strong>Noncurrent assets</strong>, like store equipment, are listed below.

On the liabilities side, <strong>current liabilities</strong> like accounts payable to suppliers, wages to employees, and taxes payable are listed first. The <strong>noncurrent liabilities</strong>, like bank debt, are placed underneath.

There are also Owners' Equity considerations, but first, I would like to insert a small comment about working capital. <strong>Working capital</strong> is the amount of money that a company constantly <em>works with</em> as part of its daily business.

It can be calculated rather simply as,
<pre>Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</pre>
Owners' Equity inherently represents the long-term obligation of a company to its owners. Companies are obligated to pay owners a return on their investment. However, since owners are paid only after all other debt payments are made, OE is placed beneath the liabilities section as a whole.

If the company is highly profitable, then the owners win. If not, owners can lose all of their investments. That's the risk of ownership.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Income Statement</strong></p>
The Income Statement shows the <em>flow</em> of activity over a specific period, rather than a simple snapshot. The period may be a month, quarter, or year. The statement is governed by the following equation,
<pre> Income = Revnue - Expenses</pre>
In other words, when revenues and expenses are matched through accrual accounting, the difference is <em>income</em>.

At the top of an income statement is the calculation of <strong>gross margin</strong>.
<pre>Gross Margin = Sales - "Direct" Cost of goods and services sold</pre>
These calculations allow readers to determine whether the company is making a profit on its goods and services.

Underneath gross margin is a list of <strong>corporate expenses</strong> and their sum. It is important to note here that the <em>allocated</em> cost of store equipment was computed through <em>matching</em>, where the useful lives of the equipment were used to estimate its yearly cost. For example, a 30k machine that has a useful life of 10 years will be recorded as costing the business 3k/year.

Then comes the <strong>Operating Income</strong>. As we move further down the income statement, more and more expenses are deducted. Here the gross margin is deducted from the selling, general, and administrative expenses. The operating profit line is simply,
<pre>Operating Income (EBIT) = Gross Margin - Corporate Expenses</pre>
<strong>EBIT</strong> is an acronym that refers to earnings before interest and taxes.

Then, of course, we subtract interests and taxes to result in the <strong>net income</strong> of a business.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Satement of Cash Flows</strong></p>
Because cash is critical for operations, all financial statements include the cash flow statement. Companies with high net income can easily go out of business when confronted with cash shortages and angry creditors for not having any cash on hand.

First off, an important concept to remember: <strong>increasing debts to suppliers frees up a business's cash for other purposes.</strong>
<pre>Cash = CL + NCL + OE - AR - INV - NCA
CL: current liabilities
NCL: noncurrent liabilities
OE: owners equity
AR: accounts recievable (assets)
INV: inventory
NCA: noncurrent assets
</pre>
Let's take a look at an actual statement and discuss its constituents. An important aspect to remember-- don't get too wrapped up in the numbers. MBAs should be focused on the logic behind these statements, and not so much on the accounting mechanics. Leave those to the CPAs.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7042" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/24739977_1477632675687163_1802171727_o-e1512351218309.jpg?w=615" alt="24739977_1477632675687163_1802171727_o" width="615" height="1024" />

<strong>The cash flow statement will help you answer the following questions about a business,</strong>
<ul>
	<li>What is the relationship between cash flow and earnings?</li>
	<li>How are dividends financed?</li>
	<li>How are debts paid off?</li>
	<li>How is cash generated by operations used?</li>
	<li>Are management's stated financial policies reflected in the cash flow?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Operating Activities</strong>
Although the income statement showed the accounting profit of $30k, it did not actually show how much cash was used or generated by the business. The cash flow statement converts the accrual basis accounting used in the other statements into a cash flow statement.

There are two steps involved in converting an accrual-based statement into a cash-based statement.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Adjust net income for noncash expenses</strong>: operating items that did not use cash but were deducted from the income statement as an expense must be added back.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjust net income for changes in working capital</strong>: changes in assets and liabilities that increase or decrease working capital must be added and subtracted from the net income.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Investing Activities</strong>
When a company buys or sells a long-term asset, the cash relating to the transaction is reflected in the investing activities section.

<strong>Financing Activities</strong>
There are two ways a company can finance itself. Borrow money or raise money from investors. Borrowing would be a long-term liability, while investments are reflected in owners' equity accounts.
<h3>IV. Ratio Analysis</h3>
There are four major categories of ratios.
<ol>
	<li>Liquidity Measures</li>
	<li>Capitalization Measures</li>
	<li>Activity Measures</li>
	<li>Profitability Measures</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Liquidity measures</strong></p>

<pre>	Can a company pay its bills comfortably?
	Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
	Current Ratio > 1 shows liquidity.
</pre>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Capitalization measures</strong></p>

<pre>	How is the company funding itself?
	Financial Leverage = (Total Liabilities + OE) / OE
	Current Ratio > 2 shows extensive use of debt.
</pre>
<pre>	How risky is the state of cash flow for the company?
	Long-term Debt to Capital = Long-term debt / (Liabilities + OE)
	Current Ratio > 0.5 shows high level of debt.
</pre>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Activity measures</strong></p>

<pre>	How actively are the firm's assets being deployed?
	Assets Turnover per period = Sales / Total Assets
	36.6 turns for a grocery store is considered normal.
</pre>
<pre>	How actively are a company's inventory is being deployed?
	Inventory Turns per Period = Cost of Goods / Average Inventory Held During Period.
	Perishable items will tend to have high turns of inventory.
</pre>
<pre>	How actively are a company's inventory is being deployed?
	Days Sales in Inventory = Ending Inventory / (Cost of Goods Sold / 365)
	Perishable items will tend to have only a few days of inventory on hand.
</pre>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Profitability measures</strong></p>

<pre>	What's the return on sales?
	Return on Sales (ROS) = Net Income / Sales
</pre>
<pre>	What's the return on equity?
	Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / OE
</pre>
These measures are widely accepted methods of measuring success; however, we need to keep in mind that a low amount of equity in a company that is <em>leveraged</em> will skew the ROE. A high level of debt means higher interest payments that a company may not be able to pay if it is doing poorly. For this reason, we must look at ratios holistically rather than honing in on any one measurement.

A common way to chart the interrelationships among relationships is through the Du Pont Chart. The chart presents the profit margin, asset turnover, return on assets, financial leverage, and return on equity in a logical fashion.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7043" src="https://nkimberly.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/23961129_1467554300028334_1631353279_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="23961129_1467554300028334_1631353279_o" width="1024" height="522" />
<h3>V. Managerial Accounting</h3>
The key difference between managerial and financial accounting is managerial accounting information is aimed at helping managers within the organization make decisions, while financial accounting is aimed at providing information to parties outside the organization.

Instead of using ratios, however, managerial accounting uses <strong>standards</strong>, <strong>budgets</strong>, and <strong>variances</strong> to explain operational results.

The <strong>standards</strong> are performance benchmarks that are required for performance comparison. Production Managers are usually in charge of establishing what should be considered the standard costs for materials, labors, and other expenses.

Then there is the <strong>budget</strong>. Factory managers work with sales managers to budget production volumes to meet forecasted demand and also maintain assembly-line efficiency.

Finally, there are <strong>variances</strong> from those budgets and standards. These variances are assessed to inform management decision making.

<strong>Price variance</strong> tells the manager how much of the difference between budgeted sales revenues and actual sales revenues is due to changes in sales price changes.
<pre> Price Variance = (Actual Sales Price - Standard Sales Price)*Actual Qty Sold</pre>
<strong>Volume variances</strong> isolate the dollar effect of a different unit volume from what was budgeted assuming no prices changes.
<pre>Vol. Variance = (Actual Qtr Sold - Standard Qty Sold)*Standard Sales Price</pre>
<strong> Efficiency variances.</strong> quantified the efficiency over a period.
<pre>Efficiency Variance = (Std Use Qty - Actual Use Qty)*Standard Cost</pre>
As with ratios, there is an infinite number of variances that could be analyzed, but overall, price and volume variances are the bread and butter of managerial accounting.
