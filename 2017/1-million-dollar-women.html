<h4>Book Review #1</h4>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Review</h2>
My best friend gifted me this book for Christmas.  It is meant for entrepreneurs looking to scale their business.  That is not who I am; however, I am interested in developing the organizational and personal skills necessary to lead large-scale initiatives in the future, so perhaps there is something interesting and useful for me, but I didn't expect there to be.  This was my perspective going in.

I allocated time to read this book for about 30 minutes every morning.  I've got to say: each of those mornings, I felt ever more driven.  I would excitedly wake up at 3:00am and reluctantly sleep at 11:00pm.  I was markedly bolder in my decision-making, more efficient at my tasks, and more kind to those around me.

The book is primarily centered around scaling up and raising venture capital funds, but Pimsleur recounts her business experience in so much detail that I felt I gained a plethora of business insight and practical tips along the way.   She covers a wide range of entrepreneurial pitfalls and provides practical and proven methods for remaining positive and pushing past naysayers.

I recommend this book to any woman looking to scale her small business or simply looking to scale her thinking.  Of course, <strong>practice goes a lot further in business than reading</strong>, so I highly urge those who read the book to also reflect and execute on the Pimsleur's exercises for the book and heed her call to action.

<strong>Rating: 9/10</strong>

<h4>CHAPTER 5: TURN MOXIE INTO MONEY</h4>
Before raising money, meet with advisers, seasons entrepreneurs, and coaches who understand the various types of fundraising (angel, venture, loans, crowdfunding, or other) to determine which kind of capital makes the most sense.

Some questions to consider for advisers,
<ol>
	<li>What kind of money should I raise?</li>
	<li>When is the right time?</li>
	<li>Where do I learn the fundraising dance?</li>
	<li>How much equity and control will I have to give up?</li>
</ol>
Some preparation before speaking to advisers:
<ol>
	<li>Explain what you expect to achieve by raising capital.</li>
	<li>What is the <em>money-making machine</em> at the heart of your business?</li>
	<li>What challenges will your business face in becoming scalable?</li>
	<li>Which part of your business is scalable?</li>
</ol>
Then, to actually raise capital, learn the fundraising dance.

<h4>CHAPTER 6: SLIP INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE</h4>
Be efficient with your networking- decide whether the event will be worth attending and track the outcome to help speculate future events. Events worth attending should help you solve short- or long- term problems, meet strategic partners, or double as a social event to provide motivational energy.

Choose events where you <em>won't</em> be the smartest person in the room.
<h4>CHAPTER 7: DELEGATE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP</h4>
Find your Best and Brightest Times: track everything you do for 3 days and how long each task takes. At the end of each day, write down everything you did, from the time you spend getting dressed to answering emails and going to the supermarket.

Create a spreadsheet and group activities into Brain Work, Workout, Play Time, Chores, etc. On a different tab, write down when you think you do each type of work best. Compare that with your actual schedule and adjust your schedule to honor these times. Make sure to tell people in your life why you are making these changes.

What are three things you can delegate? Outsource three things that you are doing at home to a babysitter, cleaning service, etc.. Do the same for work. Make sure you do the job yourself first at least once so you can hand it off properly. Trust but verify: hand it off and make sure it was done correctly. Give feedback to grow and promote your staff.
<h4>CHAPTER 8: PUTTING THE PERSON BACK IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE</h4>
Plan to take care of yourself.
