<h2 style="text-align:center;">Review</h2>
I didn't intend on reading this book. My roommate's company often suggests books for her to read, so it was already lying in the house. I picked up this book expecting to just pass some time before bed, but it turned out to be such a page turner I couldn't put it down. I felt a deep connection with Tony Hsieh. The author is this unorthodox, maverick entrepreneur who loves PLUR, skipped classes, and played pranks on his boss at work. And, since he wouldn't let anyone forget it, he is an advocate of <strong>delivering happiness</strong>.

His book examines lessons he learned from LinkExchange, the growth of Zappos, and his integration of happiness research to build Zappos into the much-loved brand it is today. LinkExchange was his first venture. And while it grew rather well, it definitely had a culture problem, so he sold it off for 265M. He knew he wouldn't that happening to his next company. At Zappos, he fought hard to do what he believed put happiness first, rather than what generated the most short-term profits. In the end, he believes the stunning growth by Zappos in the long-term was driven by this priority.

To drive employee happiness, Zappos implemented skill set raises where employees can bump up their pay by acquiring new skills. This gives people a greater sense of <b>control</b> over how much they earn. The merchandising department promotes in smaller increments every six months. Employees like it better. The sense of <b>progress</b> is continual and reinforced. Tony also works meticulously at ensuring a quality hiring process. Tony admits he only hires people who he and other employees would enjoy hanging out with outside the office. The number of good friends an employee has at work is correlated with how <b>engaged</b> that employee is. Then there's <b>vision</b>. What separates great companies from good ones is a higher vision. Something beyond money and making profits. This is paramount because employees want to be part of something with meaning.

To ensure customer happiness, Zappos focuses hard on <b>WOW</b> as a verb. By finding and hiring people who are already passionate about customer service, Tony taps into the power of positive attitude. Often underestimated is how critical a positive phone interaction is on brand loyalty and engagement. Zappos creates WOW experiences with employees trained to give customers their undivided attention for 5-10 minutes on the phone. Zappos also routinely upgrades its customers from free 5-day to free 2-day shipping both ways. And then, of course, there is the generous 365-day return policy.

Tony's ultimate point that he drives home in every chapter is this: 'If we got our culture right, then building our brand to be about the very best customer service would happen naturally on its own.' Culture is number one in delivering happiness. And building culture means living and breathing by committable, actionable core values.

With all of the focus on happiness, I couldn't help but feel recharged. Prevalent in the STEM field are cynics and pessimists. I'm sure those perspectives have their own benefit, but it started to feel like the industry was changing me at the core. I often felt ostracized for being happy and condescended for my optimism. Stumbling across a read like this has been rather restorative.

I should mention I took a slight pause around the middle of the book, where there were about a dozen employee stories included for us to read. It was rather overkill in my opinion. I suppose for the skeptics, it was necessary, Zappos does what a lot of companies can't. It created the Zappos culture book, a compilation of views from Zappos employees about company culture\. This book is available to on the Internet to anyone. Reading it allows the public to get a real sense of what the culture of Zappos is like. That is admirable. I'm just not sure I would have stuck a dozen of those in this book.

Rating: 9/10
