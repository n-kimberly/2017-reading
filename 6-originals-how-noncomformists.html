<h4 style="text-align:left;">Book Review #6</h4>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Review</h2>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">I relish the research presented in this book that countered a lot of popular myths today surrounding 'originals': individuals who have brought forth originality and innovation. I felt enlightened while reading the research on why Holocaust 'rescuers' chose to save others while the 'bystanders' chose to bide by the status quo, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it is often 'idea selection', rather than 'idea generation', that has become the barrier to innovation.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Occasionally, the discussions felt redundant, and I didn't think there needed to be so many pages on birth order. However, I think that overall, this book employed original and insightful metadata to persuade me that as a society, we should re-think our judgement of troublemakers, re-frame our approach toward our emotions, and re-evaluate how we can go about effecting profound change in our communities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Rating: 9/10</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Notes</h2>
<h4><em>Creative Destruction: The Risky Business of Going Against the Grain</em></h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Those who suffer by a system are paradoxically the least likely to challenge it.</p>
<!--more-->
<h4>Blind inventors and one-eyed inventors: the art and science of recognizing original ideas</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">NBC's tastemakers and test audiences flat out rejected Seinfield, while Steve Jobs boasted that the Segway would go onto change how cities were built.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">As research has it, inventors, alongside their test audiences and managers, are historically poor evaluators of their own ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Peers, on the other hand, are twice as likely to accurately predict the success of an idea.</p>

<h4>Out on a limb: speaking truth to power</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The “exposure effect,” is the idea that successful innovators need to repeat their idea over and over until it’s accepted, particularly if it is a bold and unfamiliar idea.  People tend to reject the unknown. See Carmen Medina, who fought for transparency at the CIA.</p>

<h4>Fools rush in: timing, strategic procrastination, and the first-mover disadvantage</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Compared to their less extraordinary peers, both America's most creative architects and India's most successful CEO's are less efficient and prompt.</p>

<h4>Goldilocks and the Trojan Horse: creating and maintaining coalitions</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Goldilocks Rule: Lucy Stone remained temperate, and even managed to convert adversaries into admirers. Because of Stone, the woman's suffrage movement was a success. She made sure the message was 'just right' - rallying even the The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, formerly alienated by Anthony and Stanton.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Trojan Horse Strategy: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/06/01/ubeams-meredith-perry-shows-her-stealth-wireless-charging-technology-really-works/102336880/">Meredith Perry</a> wanted to create a product that hadn't been done before. Technical experts thought her idea was foolish and refused to help her. So Meredith started to not disclose her idea to people, and instead simply recruited blue-chip collaborators to design parts based on her specs. Putting it all together herself, Meredith then achieved sufficient proof of concept to landed funding for her wireless power supply.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Grant's point: sharing a bold vision inspires people. But when your vision is so bold that  it provokes skepticism, you can disguise it as something more prosaic.</p>

<h4>Rebel with a cause: how siblings, parents, and mentors nurture originality</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Holocaust 'rescuers' received an explanation-based form of discipline from their parents, while 'bystanders' tended to be given many rules they had to follow.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Children disciplined into so many rules at home tend to think less for themselves.</p>

<h4>Rethinking group-think: the myths of strong cultures, cults, and devil's advocates</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In Silicon Valley, when startups hire employees primarily for cultural fit instead of skills or potential, they have the highest odds of survival but the slowest growth rates once they go public.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Diversity is the way to go if we want a company that lasts. Cultural fit only really helps everyone get on the same page and execute on the one<strong> </strong>idea.</p>

<h4>Rocking the boat and keeping it steady: managing anxiety, apathy, ambivalence, and anger.</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Right before giving a big presentation, if we're nervous, we should convert that nervous energy into excitement rather than trying to become calm. It's like driving a car-- dissipating momentum is hard, so re-purposing it is a better strategy.</p>
