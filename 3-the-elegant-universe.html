<h4><em>Brian Greene is a physicist who has made string theory widely accessible to public audiences. He is currently a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University in New York. Greene received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University and his doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. His book The Elegant Universe was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in general nonfiction.</em></h4>

<h4>Book Review #3</h4>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Review</h2>
Brian Greene must have done an insane amount of writing and editing to produce this book. It is incredible how he was able to fit in so many topics with such depth without losing the reader.

Greene leverages analogies with such skill and precision that he makes theoretical physics almost coherent to everyday scientists and engineers. On top of that, The Elegant Universe manages to cover a wide range of topics without introducing a single computation. That's when you know he's really got this stuff nailed down.

The Elegant Universe is one of those books that I would love to read again. The tone is friendly and the topics are wide-ranging. The book by no means makes an expert, but Greene is so skilled at his craft that I managed to internalize the primary concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory from his book alone. I have been able to engage much better with physics lovers thanks to this work.

<strong>Rating: 10/10</strong>

There are a lot of notes online. I may write my own version in the future, but time is of the essence currently, so here I've listed the table of contents without my notes as well as some links to good resources online.
